----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Welcome to the NBA Team Database! This application uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create an exciting way to allow users to search for their favorite NBA team. Using this application allows the user to access a number of features, such as:
                
                * Search NBA teams by division using a submit form
                * Select a conference for NBA teams (East or West) using buttons
                * Learn basic facts about each team using the "more info" buttons
                * A reset button to bring the page back to the home screen after a previous selection
                * A secret surprise sound if the NBA logo is double-clicked
